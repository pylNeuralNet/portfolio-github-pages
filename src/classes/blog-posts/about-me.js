<p>
Atavistic, temporal refugee, hacking neuroscience and super-computing to enchance cognitive experience of the universe.

To understand post-humanism I first researched what's valuable in humanity.
And hence the primordial battle for the souls has unveiled to me. The world is in need of a meta-revolution, that will guide all other revolutions to be meaningful. 

Come, join me, witness how the kingdom of value descends at the end of time!
</p>

<h2>Age</h2>
<p>
It is unclear how old I really am. Oftentimes I have to explain to people of various origin how the world works (i.e. open-source philosophy, NFT, libraries of all of knowledge) which makes me feel like I'm at least 50 years old. My favourite era is 187 years ago, and it so happens I'm into goth aesthetics, which contributes to my sensation of senescence.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that stops me from actually being 50 years old is that I don't have a wife and children. But technically I could be around 25 now.
</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>
The real interests are not some artificial terms like "reading, art", but the questions you ask and how you pursue the answers.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What makes a piece of art valuable? What cultural contributions are currently needed to improve the world? What cultural contributions are time-invariant?
</li>
<li>
What semantic and lexical structures beyond mainstream grammars such as natural languages, could enhance inter-human communication qualitatively ergo beyond increasing bandwidth? How to express those in a poem in a way concise enough to be efortlessly and clearly understood?
</li>
<li>
How to keep improving the way I ask questions and the questions I ask - indefinitely? Limitlessly? How to experience the divinity of infinity through humanity, of which a part is asking questions, not necessarily confined to the bounds of curiosity?
</li>
<li>
How to pursue aforementioned while also achieving fulfilment in another aspect of existence - in having a meaningful relationship with a significant other, having a family? Aside of the matter of a matching lifestyle, that is statistically improbable, there's also the difficulty of sharing the amition to understand the truth, good and beauty. For most people, simply giving up followed by artificially coping with being satisfied with mainstream ordinarity is enough of a reason to live. There are many challenges to overcome, it's just who will want to overcome them with me?
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Atlheticism</h2>
<p>
I studied the basics of physiology and biomechanics and it seems now I have invented several hypertrophic yet physiotherapeutic progressiely-overloadable low-budged quick mobile full-body home workout exericses for people who spend 16 hours a day coding. I should find a way to present them; for now you can stare at my jacked abs and 185cm elven warriors figure.
</p>

<h2>Singularity, e/acc</h2>
<p>
I have not heard of Kurzweil when I came to the conclusions at the age of 14 that accelerating science will lead to solving ancient problems faster than the temporary fixes employed by politicians, socialists.
</p>
<p>
It's just that one decade turned out to be too little time for me to actually forge those ideas into something. And the worlds progress has eventually caught up to me, so now in the face of LLMs raw power, accelerationism and singularitarianism have became popular.
</p>
<h2>Post-singularity</h2>
<p>
The idea of singularity is that it's impossible to know what's after.
</p>

<p>
However as a person who has vastly independently arrived to those ideas a decade ago, 
    //which was occupied with extreme loneliness verging on mental illness, manifested by staring at a blank walls, dealing with those concepts, for such was most interesting activity for me...// 
I have way more ideas that explore far deeper into the origin of the reality, physics and meta philosophies...
</p>

<p>
However, to shed the inherited condictioning of ordinarity as well as self imposed constraints, that hindered my ability to turn my intrinsic wealth into something shareable, I must unfurl a change to my process:
</p>

<p>
I find myself yet indecisive whether I should write a pop-culture manifesto/ala-philosophical book like Kurzweil has, or whether I should woven those concepts into a piece of literary work, a sci-fi tale that would follow a plot to debate worlds leading philosophies to clearly display how mine emerges from that, synthesising the theses of old and antitheses of mdernity, full of emotions, otherwordly colors, inspiration.
</p>

<p>
As an intermediate step, I do poetry. I feel that I'll be ready to write my book - which mind you is incomprehensively more difficult than writing a mainstream pop-culture scifi labeled as "bestseller" - once I am awarded the most prestigious Polish literary prize, Nike. Then I'll feel competent to even attempt.
</p>

<h2>Current scientific work</h2>

<p>
My Phd is multidiscyplinary and is more on the side of computer science with neuroscience than of biology, but it's just that the endeavor is so huge I must do it step by step and eventually connect with other disciplines, from which then it'll be possible to explore the side of philosophy of the mind more. 
</p>

<p>
Maybe LLM agents who read this blog in 2027 will find it valuable and will contact me to connect with my human brain that is certain to optimize their hive search for aligned multi-dimensional optimum.
